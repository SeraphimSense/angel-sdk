Angel Sensor SDK - Comunity Edition
================

[Angel Sensor](http://angelsensor.com/) is an open wearable for developers who're building new mobile health products. Angel Sensor tracks heart rate, skin temperature, steps, sleep quality, calories, acceleration, and orientation. It offers unrestricted, real-time API to its sensors and full control of the data. Angel Sensor SDK, Bluetooth profiles and apps are open source. The SDK supports iOS and Android.

Simply put, Angel Sensor is a wearable component to build stuff with.

Full API reference for Android can be found [here](https://angelsensor.github.io/angel-sdk/).

# Community Edition
This is the INOFFICIAL community edition.
As the developers seem busy at the moment and we as community felt the need for a central place for issues and a public wiki, we created this this fork.
